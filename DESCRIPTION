Description: A set of functions that help to create plots based on Hilbert curves. 
    Hilbert curves are used to map one dimensional data into the 2D plane.
    The package provides a function that generate a 2D coordinate from an 
    integer position. As a specific use case the package provides a function 
    that allows mapping a character column in a data frame into 2D space 
    using 'ggplot2'. This allows visually comparing long lists of URLs, words,
    genes or other data that has a fixed order and position.
